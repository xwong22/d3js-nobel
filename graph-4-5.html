                    The first person in history to accomplish the feat of twice receiving a Nobel Prize was the Polish
                    scientist <strong>Marie Skłodowska Curie</strong> (7th November, 1867- 4th July, 1934), first
                    awarded the prize in Physics and, later, in Chemistry. She was awarded for her researches in the
                    radiation phenomena, and then later, the discovery of the elements radium and polonium.

                    <strong>John Bardeen</strong> (23rd May, 1908 – 30th January, 1991) is the only scientist in history
                    to have received
                    two Nobel Prizes in the Physics category. He is first awarded for researches on semiconductors and
                    the discovery of the transistor effect, then awarded again for the theory of superconductivity,
                    jointly developed with two other laureates.

                    <strong>Frederick Sanger</strong> (13th August, 1918 – 19th November, 2013) is an enthusiast of
                    biochemistry who
                    succeeded in determining the amino acid sequence of a protein and, later, developing a method to
                    read DNA.

            <h2>Is there an underlying relation between these 3 fields?</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>We want to investigate if there is an underlying relation between the topics in the three fields of
                    study. Therefore, we did a <strong>topic analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
                        model</strong>.
                    <br> <br>If there is a
                    clear distinction between the three fields, then each field should clearly incline to one of the
                    three topics. From the movement of circles within the ternary plot, we can tell that there is a
                    change in the topic that the laureates are interested in (each circle represent a laureate)
